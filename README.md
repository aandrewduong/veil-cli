## Example Scenarios

### üìå Scenario 1: Auto-Enrollment on Registration Day  
I want Veil to **automatically enroll** me when my registration opens.  
1. Set `Mode` to **`Signup`** and fill in `settings.csv`.  
2. To fully automate registration, first run **Signup** or **Release** mode to save the registration time.  
3. The program will **sleep** until 5 minutes before your registration time, then attempt to enroll you.  

---

### üìå Scenario 2: Monitoring a Waitlisted Class  
I want to enroll in a class but the **waitlist is full**!  
1. Set `Mode` to **`Watch`** in `settings.csv`.  
2. Run Veil ‚Äì it will continuously check for openings.  
3. Once a **waitlist spot** is available, **Watch mode** will initiate a **Signup** task to enroll you.  

---

### üìå Scenario 3: Accessing an Unpublished Course Catalog  
I need the class catalog for a **future term** that isn‚Äôt published yet.  
- Simply run **Search mode** ‚Äì Veil will generate the term ID locally without relying on FHDA's API.
